We created this web application to promote group formation within a community by explictly removing all the external characteristics of one to improve the collaboration of people with different background, especially at current time when projects have been online rather than in person. It is hard for individual to form groups with people truly matching their skills, goals, and behaviors. To achieve more efficient group formation, we implemented **Group By**. 

## Usage

We implemented our own APIs using Node.js frontend with React, and database with MongoDB

### Installing dependencies

```bash
npm install
cd server
npm install
```

### Run frontend

```bash
npm start
```

### Run server 

```bash
