## Proposal I
***Group Formation Platform***
### Problem statement & motivation:
- Group assignments are commonly used in different courses across different subjects. There are studies and research stating that students would benefit from the group assignments. However, there are many reporting bad group assignment experiences. The first problem is the ***difficulty to form a group***, especially for a course with a large class size, such as CS 409. Students are unfamiliar with each other, so they can hardly find a partner with similar interests and complementary characteristics. With this problem in mind, we are eager to address such issue by designing and implementing a platform to address such problem. 
### User Problem
- Essentially, we are trying to create a web app platform for any group required community to form a group. The user group spans from students from any level, to any online webinar or event that requires group formation. This platform would be extremely beneficial to those who are unfamiliar with each others. 
### Basic Design
- We plan to implement a ***two-sided matching model*** to improve the group formation process, by highlighting the potential **complementarities** and **substitutions** among partner characteristics. Users could view others’ basic information, including experience, and skills, with their goals and opinions of group assignment. Each user would be considered as a data point on the database, and their skills, goals, requirements, expectations, etc, would be the different attributes.
#### Frontend
- We are planning to use ***React*** as our main Frontend framework
#### Backend
- We are planning to use PostmanAPI and MongoDB for the backend database and interactions. 
### Other applications
#### Existing Apps
- To form a group, many often used the course communication platform such as Campuswire, Discord, Piazza to search for teammates. There are, of course, other similar app like CatMe made by Purdue University.
#### How are we different
- We are different. Because we are implementing a Two side matching software that maximizes the freedom of the user with enough informatino for the both parties. Campuswire, Discord, etc, often have one user requesting for a group, and then many individuals or groups reply, or one group requesting a few more users, and a few individuals reply. We provide a mean in both direction, providing maximum freedom and transparency between any existing groups and the individuals. Inidivduals could see which groups need more people, or any other individual also looking for a group.

## Proposal II
***Group Collaboration Platform***
### Problem statement & motivation:
The second most complaining issue is the unequal contribution in the group, which would decrease the effectiveness of group assignments. Therefore, considering the potential advantages of group assignments, we’d like to develop a collaboration platform to increase the efficiency of group matching and the user experience of group assignments.
